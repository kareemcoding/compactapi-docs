## What can you build 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Our APIs are general purpose">
    We don't build for specific use-cases or industries in mind.
  </Step>
  <Step title="They're small, focused & composable">
    Use our APIs together or standalone, start/stop at any time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="They're built for developers">
    Expect nothing but reliable, versioned & performant APIs with in-depth documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You can use them however you want">
    So long as you [respect the limits](https://example.com) & pay your bills we don't care what you do.
   </Step>

## Who we are

We optimise for our happiness, your happiness & operational excellence, everything else is bullshit. According to modern standards, **we're the worst SaaS ever**. Expand below for why.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How we build" icon="code">
  **You vote, we build.**

  It's really simple. Visit [feedback.compactapi.com](https://example.com).

  See something you like, upvote it.

  Want something else, suggest it.

  If more than a few people think it's useful, we'll likely build it!

  **What we don't do**
  - A/B test or experiment with our users
  - Build custom shit for large customers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How we support" icon="phone">
  **First class support for everyone**

  If you're messaging support it's likely our fault. You shouldn't need to contact us to use our product. So when you do we're taking it seriously and will likely add/remove/build/fix something to make sure you don't need to again.

  **What we don't do**
  - No account managers
  - No outsourced support
  - No priority queue for VIPs
  </Accordion>
     <Accordion title="How we price" icon="wallet">
        **No more subscriptions please**

        Most companies are lost in the rat race for MRR. We're not. There's one price for everyone and that's it. You have a pre-paid wallet and top-up when you need. Anything you didn't use can be refunded right back to you.

        **What we don't do**
          - No sales teams
          - No volume pricing
          - No recurring fees
        </Accordion>
           <Accordion title="How we market" icon="globe">
                 **Nobody is buying the bullshit**

                 Most marketing sites now are AI generated, fancy gradient, bullshit. They optimise for Google's algorithm, not for you. They generate 1,000s of garbage pages just so when someone searches for "How do I concatenate two cells in Google Sheets" they hope the Google rank them over someone else.

                 We only write useful & interesting content and focus our efforts on building incredible APIs you can rely on at any scale.

                **What we don't do**
                - We don't speak nonsense, what does "military-grade encryption" even mean!?
                - We don't spew auto-generated bullshit onto the internet
                - We don't have a fancy marketing site or landing pages
                - We don't send you garbage emails to 'keep you engaged'
